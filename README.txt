Astar implementation


This is a python program that requires python 3.6 or higher to run.
By default it prints a trace of its run. This printing can be used
to determine if it is behaving correctly since it prints every
node it visits and its adjacency list.

If this trace is not desired comment out line 140 in graph.py 

To run the A star version of the program type make Astar.
To run the Dijkstra's version of the program type make Dijkstra.

This helps to show how the heuristic alters the program.
